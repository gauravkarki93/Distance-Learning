# Distance Learning
Created a website which would help students to access class material and check grades online.

## Overview 

1. The project is built using Java Enterprise Edition. Java is an object oriented
programming language (OOPs). On the web, Java can be used on the client side to create
applets and on the server side to create dynamic web pages using Servlets and Java
Server Pages (JSP).

2. It uses the MVC framework in its design. The key motivation behind the MVC
approach is the desire to separate the code that creates and manipulates the data from the
code that represents the data.

3. RDMS used to store the data.
